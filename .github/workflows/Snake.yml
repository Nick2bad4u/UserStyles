# This GitHub Actions workflow is named "Snake" and generates a snake game SVG based on a GitHub user's contribution graph.
# The workflow is triggered by three events:
# 1. Automatically every 24 hours using a cron schedule.
# 2. Manually through the GitHub Actions interface.
# 3. On every push to the master branch.

# The workflow has read permissions for the contents of the repository.

# The workflow consists of a single job named "generate" which has write permissions for the contents.
# The job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu and has a timeout of 5 minutes.

# The job includes the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the step-security/harden-runner action to enhance security by auditing egress traffic.
# 2. Generate SVG: Uses the Platane/snk/svg-only action to generate the snake game SVGs based on the GitHub user's contribution graph.
# 3. Push SVG to Output Branch: Uses the crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages action to push the generated SVGs to the "output" branch,
#    making them available as raw content or as a GitHub page. The GITHUB_TOKEN secret is used for authentication.
